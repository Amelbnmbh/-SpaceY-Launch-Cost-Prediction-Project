# SpaceY-Launch-Cost-Prediction-Project

## Project Overview

In this project, I take on the role of a data scientist for a new rocket company, SpaceY, which aims to compete with SpaceX in the commercial space industry. The objective is to analyze the cost of rocket launches and determine the factors influencing the reuse of SpaceXâ€™s Falcon 9 first stage.

## Objectives

- **Data Analysis:** Collect and analyze public data on SpaceX launches to understand pricing and recovery dynamics.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of the first stage being reused based on mission parameters.
- **Visualization:** Create interactive dashboards to visualize key insights related to launch costs and first-stage recovery.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Analysis Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-learn
- **Data Visualization Libraries:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Dashboard Framework:** Plotly Dash
- **Mapping Library:** Folium
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
